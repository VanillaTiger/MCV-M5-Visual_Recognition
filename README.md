# Week 5: Hands on Detectron -- Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with Out of Context Datasets. 

Main tasks:

(a) Out-of-Context Dataset:

 - [x] Get qualitative results on Out-of-Context Dataset
 - [x] Analyze the results. Why do you think it fails if it fails?

(b) MSCOCO Dataset by transplanting new objects by co-occurrence:

 - [x] Transplant objects from test set of COCO
 - [x] Transplanting New Object according to Co-occurrence of objects. Refer to Figure 1 in original paper
 
(c) MSCOCO Dataset by qualitatively Transplant:

- [x] Transplant objects from test set of COCO
- [x] Qualitatively Transplant Existing Object - Refer to Figure 2 in original paper


(d) MSCOCO Dataset by Feature interference:

- [x] Transplant objects from test set of COCO
- [x] Feature interference according to Co-occurrence of objects - Refer to Figure 3 in original paper
