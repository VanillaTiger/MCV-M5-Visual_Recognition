#### Dataset
MIT_Split

![](week1/Images/Dataset_Sample.jpeg)

The principal task is to adapt the model developed on M3 _DogNet_ from Keras to Pytorch.

Inside `week1/` are the files `pytorch_code.py` and `keras_code.py` with the same Neural Network architecture implemented in pytorch and keras respectively.

Tasks found in the slides: 

    - [x] NN architecture description. 

    - [x] Description of hyperparameters used. 
    
    - [x] Plot of the results.
    
    - [x] Compare and coment results.
